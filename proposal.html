<h1>Project 3 Proposal: Minesweeper</h1>

<ul>
    <li>High Concept: In my Minesweeper Project, I will attempt to recreate the iconic Windows game. I plan to have a fully playable game,
        and a lot of custom options to have different games. I may try to recreate the original artstyle, or I may create a unique artstyle.</li>
    <li>Genre: Puzzle Game.</li>
    <li>Platform: Desktop Web, since on mobile it may be really hard to press the small squares</li>
    <li>Story: No Story</li>
    <li>Aesthetics: Simple pixel artstyle, similar to the original game</li>
    <li>Gameplay: Players will have two main actions: marking squares with flags, and clicking squares to get rid of them. Clicking a mine ends the game, and you win if you click all of the non-mine squares.</li>
    <li>About the developer: My name is Igor Polotai. I am a GDD and History double major at RIT, with an interest in anything art, story, music, or design related. During my free time, I like studying history.</li>
