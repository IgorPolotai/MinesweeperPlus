<h1>Project 3 Instructions: Minesweeper</h1>

<ul>
    <li>For my project 3, I am recreating the iconic Minesweeper game.</li>
    <li>I recreated all of the original sprites myself so they look authentic.</li>
    <li>To play, select one of the difficulty modes. They change mine count and board size.</li>
    <li>If you don't know the rules of Minesweeper, click here: <a href="https://minesweepergame.com/strategy/how-to-play-minesweeper.php" target="_blank">Rules</a></li>
    <li>Note: Not everything in the linked website is implemented yet</li>
    <li>Press R to restart, and space while in game to switch between remove mode, flag mode, and question mode.</li>
    <li>When in flag mode, clicking on a tile will place a flag, but won't remove it.</li>
    <li>Using the flag mode to mark down where you think the mines are.</li>
    <li>Question mode is the same as flag mode, but is meant for you to mark down spots where you're unsure.</li>
    <li>Flags, on the other hand, are more useful to label your final guesses.</li>
    <li>You win when you reveal every non-mine tile.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Feedback, Known Issues, & Not Completed Things</h1>

<ul>
    <li>The first click is not safe. You can easily click a mine and instantly lose. This will be fixed</li>
    <li>I also will create the algorithm to remove adjacent blank squares.</li>
    <li>This algorithm is definitely the most complicated part of the game, and so far isn't working.</li>
    <li>Currently, you can only reveal one square at a time.</li>
    <li>One small bug I know of is that the first flag you place reveals what's underneath, but only for a split second</li>
    <li>I'm not sure why, but that's something I need to fix. This doesn't happen in Question mode, I'm pretty sure.</li>
    <li>Finally, I also plan to add a custom difficulty, where you can set board size and mine count.</li>
    <li>Maybe also spruce up the overall interface.</li>
    <li>For Feedback, be sure to tell me anything else you find, and give suggestions for additional content.</li>
    <li>Thanks for reading!!!</li>
